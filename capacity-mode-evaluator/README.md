# Table Capacity Mode Optimization Tool

The Table Capacity Mode Optimization Tool analyzes DynamoDB table usage (metrics), simulate autoscaling behavior based on the specified parameters and generate recommendations for optimizing capacity mode and provisioning.

### Features

- Retrieves DynamoDB table information and autoscaling settings
- Retrieves the following metrcis from CloudWatch:
  - ProvisionedReadCapacityUnits (1 hour period)
  - ProvisionedWriteCapacityUnits (1 hour period)
  - ConsumedReadCapacityUnits (1 minute period)
  - ConsumedWriteCapacityUnits (1 minute period)
- Estimates Provisioned Capacity units by simulating autoscaling behavior based on the above metrcis and the specified read/write utilization targets and minimum/maximum units parameters.
- Generates a capacity mode recommendations based on specified parameters.

**Scaling simulation behavior:**

- **Scale-out**: When consumed reads or writes exceeds the target utilization for two consecutive data points(two minutes).
- **Scale-in**: When consumed reads or writes falls %20 below the target utilization for 15 consecutive data points(15 minutes). It performs scale-in up to four times as needed, after which it scales in once every 1-hour windows within a day. This is to simulate the DynamoDB's scale-in limitation.

**Limitations:**  

- The recommendations generated by the tool are based on the above metrics for the number of days specified by `DAYS_LOOK_BACK`. Due to CloudWatch metrics with a period of 60 seconds (1 minute) are available up to 15 days.
- The tool can not consider the scaling delays (the time it takes for the DynamoDB Autoscaling service to perform a scaling operation) when simulating the autoscaling behavior. Refer to AWS DynamoDB Autoscaling [docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/AutoScaling.html) for further information and how it works.

Be aware that changing the capacity mode can have an impact on the applications, so be sure to test any changes thoroughly before making them in production.

## Choosing Capacity Mode in DynamoDB

DynamoDB capacity modes determine how your tables will scale to handle varying levels of read and write traffic. It's important to understand the cost implications of each mode to make informed decisions about which mode to use.

There are two capacity modes available in DynamoDB:

- [**Provisioned Mode:**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.ReadWriteCapacityMode.html#HowItWorks.ProvisionedThroughput.Manual) In this mode, you specify the read and write capacity for your table and DynamoDB reserves that capacity for your use. You pay a predictable hourly rate for the amount of capacity you provision.

- [**On-Demand Mode:**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.ReadWriteCapacityMode.html#HowItWorks.OnDemand) In this mode, DynamoDB automatically scales the read and write capacity for your table in response to traffic. You pay for only the requests that you make.

### Provisioned Mode

- Provisioned mode is ideal for workloads that have consistent traffic patterns or predictable spikes in traffic.
- Provisioned mode provides better performance predictability and enables users to fine-tune capacity to their needs.
- Provisioned mode is also less expensive than on-demand mode for predictable workloads.

 **Note:** Use auto-scaling to ensure that your tables can handle capacity changes automatically without manual intervention.

### On-demand mode

- On-demand mode is ideal for workloads with unpredictable or infrequent traffic patterns.
- On-demand mode allows users to pay only for the capacity they consume without having to manually adjust capacity.
- On-demand mode can be more expensive than provisioned mode for predictable workloads.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials and region
- Required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Create Python Virtual Environment for clean install

    ```sh
    python3.8 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. Install the required Python packages:

    ```sh
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Set up the AWS CLI with appropriate credentials and region if you haven't done so already.
2. Run the `capacity_reco.py` script:

    - default values:
        - `TABLE_NAME`: DynamoDB table name (optional; if not provided, the script will process all tables in the specified region)
        - `READ_UTILIZATION`: DynamoDB read utilization (default: `70`)
        - `WRITE_UTILIZATION`: DynamoDB write utilization (default: `70`)
        - `MINIMUM_WRITE_UNIT`: DynamoDB minimum write unit (default: `1`)
        - `MINIMUM_READ_UNIT`: DynamoDB minimum read unit (default: `1`)
        - `MAXIMUM_WRITE_UNIT`: DynamoDB minimum write unit (default: `80000`)
        - `MAXIMUM_READ_UNIT`: DynamoDB minimum read unit (default: `80000`)
        - `DAYS_LOOK_BACK`: Number (1-14) of days to look back (default: `14`)

    - with default values:

        ```sh
        python3 capacity_reco.py
        ```

    - with the desired values:

        ```sh
        python3 capacity_reco.py --dynamodb-tablename TABLE_NAME --dynamodb-read-utilization READ_UTILIZATION --dynamodb-write-utilization WRITE_UTILIZATION --dynamodb-minimum-write-unit MINIMUM_WRITE_UNIT --dynamodb-minimum-read-unit MINIMUM_READ_UNIT --dynamodb-maximum-write-unit MAXIMUM_WRITE_UNIT --dynamodb-maximum-read-unit MAXIMUM_READ_UNIT --number-of-days-look-back DAYS_LOOK_BACK [--debug]
        ```

    Add the `--debug` flag to save metrics and estimates as CSV files in the `output` folder.

3. The output files will be saved in the `output` folder.

## Output

Check the generated files in the `output` folder. [Here](static/recommendation_summary.csv) is an example output
