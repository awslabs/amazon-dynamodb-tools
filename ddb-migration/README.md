# 🔄 DynamoDB Migration Project

This sample development project presents the content explained in the [DynamoDB migration playbook](./documentation/migration-playbook.md). ⚠️ This project is not intended to be deployed in production as-is, and it is your responsibility to complete and run proper testing in lower environments. ⚠️

## 🚀 Getting Started

To execute this CDK project, you'll need to provide the `sourceTableArn` and the `destinationTableArn` DynamoDB table ARNs.

📋 Before you begin, ensure your shell has credentials for the account you're operating in through your AWS profile or your environment variables.

Copy and paste your table ARNs into the shell variables while setting the correct AWS region to deploy the resources:

```bash
# Change to match your region. This should be the same region as the source table.
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
# The source table should be in the same account as the deployed resources.
export SOURCE_TABLE_ARN=arn:aws:dynamodb:us-east-1:111122223333:table/my-source-table
# If destination table is in a different account, follow the 'Cross-account access' section
export DEST_TABLE_ARN=arn:aws:dynamodb:us-east-1:111122223333:table/my-source-table-migrated
```

## 🍎 Setup for macOS (for brand new users)

If this is your first time running any CDK application and you happen to be on macOS, follow these instructions first to install dependencies.

**Prerequisites:**

- You should have [brew](https://brew.sh/) installed.
- You should set `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` to the region you want to operate in.

Install the following packages with brew to begin:

```bash
brew install typescript
brew install aws-cdk
brew install node
```

With npm, Install the aws-cdk-lib to start:

```bash
npm i aws-cdk-lib
```

Then you need to bootstrap CDK:

```bash
cdk bootstrap -c sourceTableArn=$SOURCE_TABLE_ARN -c destinationTableArn=$DEST_TABLE_ARN
```

### 🚀 Deployment

The following command will generate the synthesized CloudFormation template, you can use this output to explore the stack that will be generated.

```bash
cdk synth -c sourceTableArn=$SOURCE_TABLE_ARN -c destinationTableArn=$DEST_TABLE_ARN
```

Once you are ready to deploy your solution you can execute it with the following command. Please remember the source table needs to have Amazon DynamoDB streams enabled.

```bash

cdk deploy -c sourceTableArn=$SOURCE_TABLE_ARN -c destinationTableArn=$DEST_TABLE_ARN

```

### 🌐 Cross-account access

The resources for the migration as well as the source DynamoDB table must be in the same account, but the destination table can be in any account. However, you must update the destination table's permissions with a [resource-based policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/access-control-resource-based.html) created and placed into the CloudFormation stack Outputs section in order for the replication to work.

1. Run the `cdk deploy` command and note the output of the IAM policy in the Output _DestinationTablePolicy_.
1. Copy the IAM policy into your clipboard. This is a resource-based policy that must be applied to the destination DynamoDB table in your destination account. If you do not see this output, the script has determined the source and destination are the same AWS account. You can also see this output on the CloudFormation stack in the AWS Management Console.
1. Follow [these developer documentation instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/rbac-attach-resource-based-policy.html) to add the policy to your destination table, preferably using the AWS Management Console.
1. Execute the code in AWS Step Functions console as normal. The Lambda function WriteCdc will write cross-account into your table with the permissions granted by this resource-based policy

> 📝 **Note:** _If you attempt to deploy this into an AWS account different from the source table's account, the CloudFormation stack creation will fail with an error due to a custom resource we made to validate account ids called AccountValidationCustomResource. If you make this mistake, you must run the clean-up step to destroy the stack._

### 🧹 Clean-up

To destroy the resources (when the migration is completed and you decide to cut-over), execute:

```bash
cdk destroy -c sourceTableArn=$SOURCE_TABLE_ARN -c destinationTableArn=$DEST_TABLE_ARN
```

### ⚠️ Current Limitations

- The current deployment assumes the deployed resources and the source table are in the same account. The destination table can be in a separate account.
- You must change the table ARNs and re-run `cdk deploy` for every table combination. You can't re-use the same stack for different table combinations.
